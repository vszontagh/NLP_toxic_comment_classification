Toxic Comment Classification with NLP

Business Case
Toxic comment classification can be useful for businesses in a number of ways. For example, if a business operates a social media platform or an online forum, it may be important to identify and remove toxic comments in order to create a positive and welcoming environment for users. This can help to reduce the risk of users becoming distressed or offended by toxic content, which can lead to negative brand associations and a decrease in user engagement and retention. Additionally, identifying and removing toxic comments can help to prevent the spread of misinformation or hateful ideologies, which can have serious consequences for both the business and society as a whole. In general, toxic comment classification can help businesses to foster a more positive and safe online community, which can ultimately lead to improved brand reputation and customer loyalty.
